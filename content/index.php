					<h2 class="title"><a href="#">FINAL MISSION: 4:30-6pm, Friday</a></h2>
					<div class="entry">
<p>Human scientists have finally developed a vaccine to neutralize the zombie virus! This cure is what we need to end the zombie plague, but once again, the scientists need the human army to fetch them more supplies before they can begin mass production at a dispersion facility. Unfortunately, this task is extremely time-sensitive. Thanks to the collective intelligence of the zombie hive mind, zombies have synthesized a way to make their virus airborne and extremely contagious, and they plan to release the disease into the air at their own dispersion facility. World domination and the collapse of society as we know it is inevitable if this is allowed to happen, but the zombies also must retrieve extra parts and supplies to make it a reality.</p>

<p>Starting at 4:30 pm, zombies will gather at their dispersion facility on the Arts Quad by Olin Library and humans will gather at their's on the opposite end of the Arts Quad by Sibley Hall. These dispersion facilities are NOT safe zones and can be freely entered by the other team if not adequately guarded at all times. Strategize with your team! At a moderator's signal, the mission will begin begin. Each team will be given a clue/puzzle leading to one of the items they need to find, and when they find the item, they will be given a clue for the next one, and so on. As a result of winning yesterday's mission, the zombie clues will be easier and contain more information. The first team to collect all of their items and successfully bring them back to their dispersion facility will win the game. If a human/zombie carrying an item is zombified/stunned, they must immediately place it down on the ground. Players may not touch the other team's items.
ALL humans and zombies are encouraged to come out for this final mission, as your side's success depends on the strength and size of your army.</p>

<p>Some rules to recall in this last mission:<br>
- Please try not to take other people's socks. Similarly, don't bring socks you are particularly attached to in case you lose them.<br>
- If a zombie is in a large group (5+) he or she may only tag two humans at a time. After these tags, the zombie is stunned. This does not apply to zombies in smaller groups.<br>
- If you are a zombie and are stunned during a large human/zombie encounter, you must immediately raise your arms into the air for 10 seconds to make it clear you are stunned and remove yourself from the area.<br>
- New zombies are stunned for 10 minutes following zombification before they can join the other team.<br>
- Stairs have been a contention point lately. Try to avoid them all together, and you will avoid sticky scenarios regarding safety rules.</p>

					<h2 class="title"><a href="#">Mission 2: 5-6pm, Tuesday</a></h2>
					<div class="entry">
<p>Defend the scientists! The goal of this mission is for humans to accompany the three scientists from this research station (located at the statue of A.D. White on the Arts Quad) to the three missing pieces of a shield generator scattered around campus and then back.</p>

<p>The scientists cannot move at all without being within 5 feet of a human, and when you pick up a scientist from the station by A.D. White, they will tell you where their piece is hidden/where your destination is. Only the scientists know how to handle such delicate machinery, so they are the only ones who can retrieve the pieces. If the humans escorting a scientist are all tagged, the scientist will stop where he is and remain there until he is picked up by another group of humans.</p>

<p>Zombies must maintain a minimum distance from the research station. Tagging a scientist does nothing.</p>

<p>Should humans succeed and return all three pieces by <u>6:00 pm</u> so that the the shield generator can be built, human safe zones will be expanded on Wednesday.</p>

<p>All three of the power cores were found by the humans! This means that the zombie stun time has increased from 5 minutes to 10 minutes. Get ready for tomorrow's mission, to be announced Tuesday morning!</p>
						<p><s>Find the three power cores! Every power core acquired extends zombie stun time by one minute. However, 
						if you find all three, zombie stun time increases by five minutes.</s>
