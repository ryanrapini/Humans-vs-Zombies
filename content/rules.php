					<div class="entry">
						<h2>Abstract</h2></p>
                        <p>The following are the official rules and regulations for Humans versus Zombies at Cornell University. Excessive or repetitive violation of these rules will result in dismissal from the game and/or a possible report to the relevant authorities.</p>
                        <p>Humans vs. Zombies is a a highly modified campus-wide game of tag lasting approximately one week. Zombies attempt to turn humans by stunning (or tagging) them. Human defend themselves by hitting a zombie with a sock ball to stun them.</p>
                        <p>The following rules are intended to cover ANY HvZ dispute or question when a moderator is not around to solve it. Keep in mind, just because we didn't explicitly ban a activity or mention a tactic does not mean that the tactic or activity is either allowed or safe (Example: Parachuting into campus, building your own cardboard tank, etc).</p>

					<h2 class="title"><a href="#">General Rules </a></h2>
					<div class="entry">
                        <p><strong>Rule #1: </strong>Don't be a douchebag</p>
                        <p><strong>Rule #2: </strong>Always follow rule #1</p>
                        <p><strong>Rule #3: </strong>Go about situations reasonably (We are all adults here. Remember this is just a game)</p>
                        <p><strong>Rule #4: </strong>If an idea seems unsafe or can hurt another player, don't do it</p>
                        <p><strong>Rule #5: </strong>If you feel like you are cheating, you probably are and should stop whatever activity you have engaged in immediately</p>
                        <p><strong>Rule #6: </strong>Do whatever seems realistic as if it were a zombie apocalypse (within the rules)</p>
                        <p><strong>Rule #7:</strong> A moderator's decision is final in any situation</p>
                        <p><strong>Rule #8:</strong> Any attempt to 'Push the boundaries of the rules' or 'walk a fine line' will be dealt with on a case by case basis, and probably severely.</p>
                        <p><strong><u>General Physical Safety Rules</u></strong></p>
                        <p>These should be obvious to all players. The purpose of this section is to explicitly mention what movements may not take place at any time during HvZ. The breaking of any of these rules will dealt with in a very, very harsh manner, and once again without mercy. Any activity not specified here that looks unsafe will be deemed to be so on the spot and the player(s) will be warned/punished/ejected on the spot.</p>
                        <p><strong>Rule #1:</strong> No jumping.</p>
                        <p><strong>Rule #2:</strong> No vaulting at fast speed over objects. Vaulting is the act of using arms or legs in order to quickly pass over rails or fences. A fast speed is anything more than a normal walking speed.</p>
                        <p><strong>Rule #3:</strong> No climbing. Period. Even for 'Recon'.</p>
                        <p><strong>Rule #4:</strong> No diving.</p>
                        <p><strong>Rule #5:</strong> Absolutely no 'Parkour' or similar activity.</p>
                        <p><strong>Rule #6:</strong> No tackling. Any player found tackling will be dealt with severely, including the possibility of police action for assault.</p>
                        <p><strong>Rule #7:</strong> No biting.</p>

                    <div class="entry">
                        <p>The objective of the humans is to survive to the last day and complete the final mission.</p>
                        <p><strong><u>Identification:</u></strong></p>
                        <p>Humans will wear a bandana around their upper arm (bicep) at all times. It may not be concealed by any object or clothing. The bandana may also not be camouflaged (by wearing very similar colors, etc).</p>
                        <p>Humans must have their ID card with them at all times. The ID consists of a unique and randomized 'kill code'. ID cards are not required for a zombie to tag a human. If for some extraordinary reason an ID card is not present for a tag, their name NetID should be given to the zombie in some way. OR, the human can take down the NetID of the zombie who tagged them and report the kill themself.</p>
                        <p><strong><u>Missions: </u></strong></p>
                        <p>Every evening, there are missions for humans to complete that will take place on central campus. If they complete them, the humans will receive a power-up or some privilege for humans as a whole.</p>
                        <p><strong><u>Defenses:</u></strong></p>
                        <p>Socks are thrown by a human to attempt to stun a zombie. Socks must be rolled into a shape resembling either a ball or cylinder. You may carry around as many socks as you like, but only one sock may be thrown at a time. Tape is allowed, but may not exceed more then 12 inches of length. The socks must be easily able to fit onto a foot of a adult human. Humans may not put any objects into the center of the socks (including tape). Do not build slingshots, catapults, or other contraptions in order to fire socks. NO NERF GUNS ALLOWED!</p>
                        <p><strong><u>Stunning:</u></strong></p>
                        <p>The act of stunning a zombie involves the zed being hit by a sock. The sock must leave the hand of the human. A sock is 'dead' once it hits any object other than air or another sock. Backpacks, bags, and other items worn by the zombie count as part of the body and a hit will count.</p>
                        <p><strong><u>Zombification:</u></strong></p>
                        <p>Congratulations! You just unlocked the best of the game! In order to be zombified, a human must first be tagged by a zombie. Look to the zombie section for what constitutes a tag. Once a tag has taken place, the former human will move their bandana to around their neck. They are now a stunned zombie and must wait the typical stun period of 10 minutes before becoming a zombie. The humans should hand their ID card to the zombie that tagged them.</p>

                    <div class="entry">
                        <p>Objective: Braaiiinnnsss....</p>
                        <p><strong><u>Identification:</u></strong></p>
                        <p>Zombies will wear the bandana around their heads. A stunned zombie wears their bandana around the neck. The bandana may not be covered, even partially, by any object. Bandanas may not be camouflaged. There are no unmarked zombies in the game past the first 24 hours, so no zombies may tag without wearing a bandana.</p>
                        <p><strong><u>Stuns:</u></strong></p>
                        <p>When you are stunned (hit with a sock) you are prohibited from interacting with the game IN ANY WAY beyond picking up socks. If you catch a sock, you are still stunned. You are out of the game for 10 minutes. If you are stunned again during this period, the 10 minutes starts over. If a zombie is part of a large group and is stunned, they must immediately raise their arms straight up for 10 seconds. While a zombie is stunned they may not relay intel to ANY zombies (active or stunned) in ANY way (cell, walkie talkie, word of mouth, etc).</p>
                        <p><strong><u>Tagging:</u></strong></p>
                        <p>A successful tag on a human requires touching their body with the full face of the palm. Just grazing them with your fingertips violates Rule #6 and doesn't count. Backpacks and other bags count as part of the body! If the human uses some form of revival mechanism, the zombie is still stunned. If a zombie shoves or tackles a player or executes any other overly kinetic stun, that stun does not count and the human gets to walk away from the scene.</p>
<p><strong><u>Reporting the Kill:</u></strong></p>
<p>The human should give the zombie their ID card. As SOON as possible, the zombie should go online to this website and click on the "Zombify People" button above. The zombies should enter THEIR NetID and the human's killcode. If this does not work, try entering your student ID instead of your NetID - some people signed up with this by accident. If there is still a problem, email a moderator with the new zombie's name and killcode and they will Zombify them for you. The zombie may attach the gold safety pin to their bandana to let others know how many humans they have zombified.</p>
 <p><strong><u>Missions: </u></strong></p>
<p>Zombies come to the missions in order to thwart the human's attempts. They may not camp too close to where the moderators are gathered. During missions, one zombie may only tag 2 people at one time. After the second tag you are stunned. This prevents one unstunned zombie taking out a large group of humans immediately after a charge. If the zombie is in a small group (â‰¤5) than this limitation does not occur. </p>

                        <p><strong><u>Sportsmanship</u></strong></p>
                        <p>The main purpose of this game is to have fun and to meet new people. The purpose of the game is not to win. If you forget this at any time, you will be assumed to be in violation of Rule #1. If you create an environment that does not promote enjoyment for others, you will be banned from the game.</p>
                        <p>Please treat people with respect. When you tag a human, do not gloat. Do not excessively exert dominance (immediately demanding the ID etc).This is considered in violation of Rule #1, and if this is witnessed OR reported to one of us, the tag may be refuted.</p>
                        <p>The vast majority of players will be zombies even before the final mission. Embrace your transfer to the winning side.</p>
                        <p><strong><u>Safe Zones</u></strong></p>
                        <p>All players may enter safe zones during game play. Humans may NOT shoot from/in safe zones. Safe zones are as follows: buildings, buses, any staircase with more than 4 steps (one step is a vertical face), 5-foot radius around doors (no tagging people as they frantically scramble to open a door), and any human bases specified by the moderators as a result of completed missions.</p>
<p>The edge of campus boundary for Collegetown is the bridge. On West Campus, it is Lake Street/the section of University Ave going North/South. If you are not on campus, both humans and zombies are safe.</p>
                        <p><strong><u>No Play Zones</u></strong></p>
                        <p>Players may NOT enter these during game play. PERIOD. These may only be entered if your "real" life requires it. The game shall never be played in these areas.</p>
                        <p>No play zones are as follows: gorge areas, any major road around campus, parking garages, Gannett medical center, loading docks for trucks around buildings, and any area with enough non-players that running into or hitting one of them with a sock would be inevitable.</p>
                        <p><strong><u>Non-Participants</u></strong></p>
                        <p>Non-participants may not interact with the game. At all. Ever. They do not exist. If you throw a sock at any of them, request intelligence from any of them, or disrupt their otherwise boring college student lives, you risk get banned from the rest of the game.</p>
                        <p><strong><u>Additional Safety Rules</u></strong></p>
                        <p>Once a human is within immediate vicinity (read: radius) of an accessible door to any Cornell facility, they are unable to be tagged.</p>
                        <p>When a human leaves a building, they are safe for 10 seconds (and can fire during this time).</p>
                        <p>When a zombie leaves a building, there is a 5 second no-tag period. They can still be stunned during this time (please don't camp doorways).</p>
                        <p>When a zombie enters from off campus, they are stunned for 5 min.</p>
